# EventsNearby

Welcome to 'Events Nearby'! In this directory, you'll find a CLI Ruby Gem. 'Events Nearby' lets you enter any location to retrieve a list of events that are near that location. Displayed will be the name of the events, when they are taking place, where exactly they are, and how much they cost. You can then choose one of the listed events to see details about that event and even open it in your browser.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'events_nearby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install events_nearby

## Usage

- Start the program
- Enter the location you want to see events nearby
- Enter a number to see more details about a specific event
- Open the chosen event in your browser if you wish or start over
